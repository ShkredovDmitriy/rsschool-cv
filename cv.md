## A bit about Myself:

I started my career as a Windows administrator in 2007. I worked in a small company and was engaged in the repair and maintenance of computers on the Windows operating system.
I also studied the Linux operating system.

In 2012 I changed my profession to Linux administrator. I worked in the same company and was engaged in the repair and maintenance of Linux data servers. During this time, I became interested in web development.

In 2017, I got a job in a company that specializes in creating websites. I changed my profession to a QA Web Tester. I have used BrowserStack, W3C Validator, Cypress, Postman, Google Lighthouse. A year later, I completed the HTML Academy online courses and changed my profession to a web developer. Despite a busy work schedule, I continue to study.

In my work, I use the latest technologies such as nodejs, webpack, git, docker, sass, pug, react, eslint, prettier. In addition to the frontend, I am also interested in the backend. In my pet projects I have used express, sequelize and mysql. Also in my spare time I study English on the Skyeng platform.

I want to work in a big and friendly team. I'd like to learn more about React.

## My skills and technologies:

- HTML5, Pug
- CSS3, Scss
- JavaScript, Jquery, React
- BEM
- Git, Github
- Webpack
- Eslint, Prettier
- VSCode, Sublime
- Docker
